# Usage:
# - source from your .bashrc
# - `vgit show` opens the commit in vim
#
# vgit is "vim git".
# It opens the git output in vim, naturally.
# It is a bad idea to use it with a long log!
#
# For other vim-related hints, see vimrc.git nearby

vgit()

    view -c "term ++curwin git --no-pager $*"

# vgit completion are the same as git's one.
